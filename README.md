# Research project for Pulmonary Fibrosis Prediction

Our model combines CT scans of patients with varying levels of pulmonary fibrosis with patient meta-data to predict the decline in lung functioning.

The model is a deep CNN combined with LSTM layers (for processing sequential cross-sectional images of the patient lung). 

It achieves a final MAE of 9.6% on a seperate test set.
